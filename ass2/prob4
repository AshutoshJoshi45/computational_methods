A stiff differential equation is a differential equation which cannot be solved by all numerical methods.
Some of the numerical methods are found to be unstable for solving them.
A common example is when the rate of change of a variable is proportional to the variable itself. 
An example is newton's law of cooling.
As discussed in class we can use backward euler method to resolve unstability. 
I could not find a library in numpy but scipy.integrate.odeint can solve stiff and non stiff differential equations.
